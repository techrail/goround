# bgRoutine (Background Routine)
This package will take care of the functionality involved and concerning background routines. This can be used for (but it not limited to) creating job systems. However, it does not try to replace an existing full-blown Job system. 

The routine manager is supposed to let you Start, Pause, Resume and Stop a routine. You can schedule a routine either with a Cron Job expression or as a function that runs every x intervals (e.g. every 20 seconds).
